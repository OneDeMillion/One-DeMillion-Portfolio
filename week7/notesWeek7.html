        <p>Promises</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pending - when a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation<li>
            <li>Unsettled - While the operation is taking place</li>
            <li>Settled - Once the operation has completed. Can result in two different outcomes:</li>
                <li>Resolved - the asynchronous operation was successfully completed</li>
                <li>Rejected - the asynchronous operation didn't work as expected, it wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error</li>
