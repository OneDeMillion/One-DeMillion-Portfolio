        <p>Errors, Exceptions and Warnings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>System error - there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle</li>
            <li>Exception - An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error</li>
            <li>Stack Trace - Also produced by an exception. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. </li>
            <li>Warning - A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.<br>
                The program will continue to run after a warning. It may not run correctly, however.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Strict Mode</p>
       <ul>
           /<li>Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features due to the fact that it considers coding practices <br>
            that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors</li>
            <li>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:<br>
                'use strict';</li>
            <li>It can be used on a per-function basis or applied as a whole to all the code, by placing all the code in a self-invoking function. This is the <br>
                recommended way.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Linting Tools</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode</li>
           <li>hey are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not <br>
            followed, such as how code is indented. They can be very unforgiving and use some opinionated coding conventions, such as not using the ++ and -- increment <br>
            operators </li>
       </ul>

       <p>Feature Detection</p>
       <ul>
           <li>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection</li>
           <li>This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method<br>
                e.g. if(window.holodeck) {<br>
                        virtualReality.activate();<br>
                }</li>
            <li> Feature detection guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and fails gracefully, without any exceptions being thrown, if the method doesn't exist</li>
       </ul>
       
       <p>Debugging in the Browser</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Alerts - The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code</li>
           <li>console.count displays the number of times the line was called</li>
           <li>console.dirxml(node) displays the node and all descendants — like a section of the HTML panel</li>
           <li>console.table outputs an object or array in a tabular format which can be inspected and re-ordered by clicking the table headings,</li>
           <li>a debugging tool allows you to setbreakpointsin your code that will pause it at certain points. You can then see the values of all the variables at those points and modify them. <br>
            This can be very useful when trying to track down bugs.</li>
            <li>The debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You can also <br>
                hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the 'play' button.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Errors</p>
       <ul>
           <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values</li>
           <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined</li>
           <li>SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax</li>
           <li>TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected</li>
           <li>URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI</li>
           <li>InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion</li>
           <li>The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop</li>
           <li>It is best practice, however, to throw an error object. This can then be caught in a catch block</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Exception Handling</p>
       <ul>
           <li>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal for development as it allows us to identify and fix errors, but <br>
            in production it will appear as though the program has crashed. it is possible to handle exceptions by catching the errors, but keeping them hidden from <br>
            users, while still keeping the program running.</li>
           <li>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. If an exception occursit will pass the error object that is thrown <br>
            onto a catch block.</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Testing</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</li>
           <li>A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should</li>
           <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. The workflow is as follows:
               <ol>
                   <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
                   <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                   <li>Refactor the code</li>
                   <li>Test refactored code</li>
                   <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
               </ol>
           </li>
           <li>TDD is considered to be best practice, but is not followed by many coders</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Testing Frameworks</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Testing frameworks provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them</li>
           <li>Jestis a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests <br>
            by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</li>
       </ul>
