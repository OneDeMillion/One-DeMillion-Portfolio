        How to Rewire your brain for mobile first
        
        “If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it’ll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful.” – Joel Marsh – The Hipper Element
        
        After 2011 Mobile devices really took off on the marketplace.
        
        Desktops replaced every 4-5 years. Single device.
        
        Mobiles replaced every 2 or so years, sometimes every year. 2-3 devices per person, per household.
        
        Just because your website is mobile responsive doesn’t mean it’s mobile first.
        
        Responsive does not equal Mobile First
        •	Cheaper and faster than ground up re-write
        •	Better mobile experience than desktop only
        •	Doesn’t address screen real estate issues
        •	Doesn’t address touch interaction issues
        
        Mobile First
        •	Time consuming and costly for a full rebuild
        •	Provide best experience across many devices
        •	Address constraints of mobile size/bandwidth
        •	Future friendly and ready for growth
        
        Desktops sales are declinining!!!
        Start small and scale up. Things grow well.
        Mobile isn’t a fad.

        How to Improve UX by Understanding Users
        
        Be there. Help users through the journey.
        
        Be Useful. Don’t make users hunt for what they want.
        
        Be Quick. Excessive steps increase frustration and user abandonment. Rather than just reduce steps, why not just delete the steps in their entirety and make it an automatic procedure.
        
        Reachability – how users handle device.
        
        Many users use mobile one handed or with just their thumb, this limits the area of the mobile device that they have access to using.
        
        With larger device they use two hands but still limits area of usage. So its important that key items are in easy access areas.
        
        Speed and loading time ties in to attention span. This effects business, because of things like drop off. (Google – ½ sec delay = 20% drop in rev; bing 2 sec = 4% rev drop; aol – fastest 10% of users stay 50% longer)
        
        Networks effect speed the most. Not everyone has access to high speeds. Many people live in rural areas or even in suburbs. You can’t assume everyone has access to the same infrastructure as you.
        
        Fixes: Reduce img usage thru site/app; Img optimization (svg/webfonts have lower bandwith); optimize/minify css&js; gzip files to elim unnecess data.

        Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design
        
        We need to make things easier for our users.
        
        The primary controls are often in the hardest to reach area of the screens. What if we moved those to the easiest parts of the screen for ‘thumb users’ to reach? Giving quick access to sub-nav.
        
        Facebook app – lots of research done – addressed reachability; created perception of spped; improved engagement rates; increased user satisfaction.
        
        Hamburger menu – many people don’t know what it means, although we think everyone knows it.
        
        Menu with border alone when tested had the higher conversion rate. 20% conv w/clicks
        Always do the research, don’t assume

        Forms
        
        Make it simple so users can think less.
        
        Big problem with forms is the amount of info being requested of user, often not required.
        
        Tips. Ditch labels and use placeholders; Use float labels; Eliminate unnecessary fields w/check boxes (e.g. phone or email, when checked applicable box appears)
        
        Break forms down into sections; Use progress indicators so user drop off reduced; Use auto complete and helps reduce errors.
        
        Password Entry is frustrating. If users can’t log in, increases support costs and reduces revenue. Masking doesn’t help cost usually, but give option to mask. 
        
        Credit info – provide auto progress. Space for easy entry and auto advance.
        Provide keyboard for best entry. Default keyboards make it harder to enter.
        Phone numbers – Most people enter number as text only. Use anchor tag so users can click and make a call.

        Mobile Advertising
        Before you advertise – Research
        
        2010 – more advertising than content
        
        We continue to use advertising meant for full size screens but smaller screens and mobiles are being used.
        
        Mobile advertising is different than desktop advertising
        
        Popups/Popovers are the most aggravating form of advertising
        
        Make ads small and simple and still be effective
        
        Have ads expand once clicked.
        
        Video ads are great at conversion rates.
        
        

        “Doing Stuff with Web Things”

        Output – info stored/shared w/user
        Input – user entry or anything coming in from storage
        Input – output called IO
        Placeholder – hint to user
        Section tags – fill screen all the way across
        .value – when want to get input (input/textarea)
        .innterHTML – when want to show something (sections)
        parseInt function – send in text, gives back integer
        Nan – Not a Number
        isNan function – confirms is not a number
        functions in script after body or js file called. I prefer to put after body so DOM loads first.
        JS
        Var  - variable – like a box you put stuff in
        Const – variable you don’t change value of (ES6)
        Let – variable you can change (ES6)
        To store something in local storage
            localStorage.setItem(var1, var2)
        To load something from storage
            e.g.
            function loadStory() {
                var storyName = document.getElementById(“name_inp”).value;
                var storyHTML = localStorage.getItem(StoryName);
                document.getElementById(“storyEditor”).value = storyHTML;
            }
